## Preface
This is Node.js Serverless Framework App based that empowers Express.js way.

## Installation
> [!TIP]
> For just a wacky-hacky experience you may wanted to run `automated-install` with PowerShell (Admin).

> [!NOTE]
> During npm installation, just ignore warning errors from mismanaged versions of `serverless-dotenv-plugin` and `serverless-offline` if you need to add more libraries just do `npm install <pkgname> --force`.

```term
npm install --force
```

## Usage
This project is expecting you to use Jest (for unit test) and your API builder (actual) so this command 
will load all serverless plugins installed. 

```term
npm start
```
