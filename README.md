## Preface
This is Node.js Serverless Framework App based that empowers Express.js way.

## Installation
> [!TIP]
> For just a wacky-hacky experience you may wanted to run `automated-install` with PowerShell (Admin) please see powershell branch.

```term
npm install
```

## Usage
This project is expecting you to use Jest (for unit test) and your API builder (actual) so this command 
will load all serverless plugins installed. 

```term
npm start
```
